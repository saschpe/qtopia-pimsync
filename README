SyncZilla
=========

SyncZilla let's you synchronize your contacts, events and appointments with your
favorite groupware software solution or groupware web-service. Every SyncML-capable
service offering should work with SyncZilla.


Prerequisites
=============

SyncZilla extensivly uses the Qt toolkit version 4.4 and the Qtopia
phone edition allowing embedded development with Qt (as well as providing
distinct phone features). Qt should be available pre-built for your platform,
see `Trolltech Qt homepage`__ for further infos.

Qtopia phone edition version 4.3.1 has to be built from source for your 
specific target platform, see `Trolltech Qtopia homepage`__ for further infos
on how to extract and build it correctly.

Default build scripts for libcurl and Funambol C++ Client API are provided,
the necessray steps depend on the target platform you want to build for.

Prepare and build prerequisites for a x86 target:

	$ cd 3rdparty/libraries/curl/
	$ bash build_x86.sh
	$ cd ../funambol
	$ bash build_x86.sh

Prepare and build prerequisites for a greenphone target:

	$ cd 3rdparty/libraries/curl/
	$ bash build_gp.sh
	$ cd ../funambol
	$ bash build_gp.sh

Install and test
================

For the x86 emulator (QVFb) you have to start the emulator first:

	$ $QPE_X86_BUILDDIR/bin/runqtopia

Then build the project for the x86 emulator and/or to have it installed
in the Qtopia flash-image (for an embedded device) you have to do
these steps:

	$ $QPE_X86_BUILDDIR/bin/qtopiamake
	$ make
	$ make install

You should then be able to select the application in the Qtopia user interface
application selector (an initial restart may be necessary to inform Qtopia of 
the new application).

Or to build a package for the greenphone (physical embedded device) do the
following steps (a Qtopia phone edition build for greenphone target is needed):

	$ $QPE_GP_BUILDDIR/bin/qtopiamake
	$ make
	$ make package
	$ $QPE_GP_BUILDDIR/scripts/greenphone-sdk/scripts/gph -i
