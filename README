SyncZilla
=========



Prerequisites
=============

* Qt-4.4 and Qtopia-4.3.1
* libcurl3-dev
* Funambol C++ Client API


Install and test
================

For the x86 emulator (QVFb) you have to start the emulator first:

	$ $QPE_X86_BUILDDIR/bin/runqtopia

Then build and run the project in the emulator:

	$ $QPE_X86_BUILDDIR/bin/qtopiamake
	$ make
	$ make install
	$ ./synctool

To build a package for the greenphone (physical device) use the following steps:

	$ $QPE_GP_BUILDDIR/bin/qtopiamake
	$ make
	$ make package
	$ $QPE_GP_BUILDDIR/scripts/greenphone-sdk/scripts/gph -i    

Or to include FileManager in the flash image do that:

	$ $QPE_GP_BUILDDIR/bin/qtopiamake
	$ make
	$ make install
	
The next steps depend on wether you want to create a Qtopia package
or include SyncTool into a flash image, please refer to the
current Qtopia documentation on how to do that.
