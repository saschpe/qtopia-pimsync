* Add OBEX sending/receiving capabilities (in conjunction with Bluetooth support). Bluetooth
  stuff is already in Qtopia platform and ready to use. The OBEX functionality should be added
  in the Funambol 3rd-party library since the HTTP transport is also implemented there.

* Have notes synced, the application has already complete support for that, but it needs some
  sort of support from Qtopia platform (see QPimModel APIs for details).

* Tweak configuration managment: Change to base64 encoding and use QXmlStreamReader for faster
  profile loading.
